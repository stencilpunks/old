<img src="about_dev.jpg" border="0" align="left">Devin<br>
Age: 29

Devin is probably the last person you'd expect to be running this site. He's been a paramedic since 2015 and is now begrudgingly studying electrical engineering at a big state school. He listened, almost exclusively, to punk and ska back in the day but now has a broader taste for music. Dispite his appreciation for punk music and culture, Devin has never been a part of the punk scene.
<br><br>
Although he spends much of his free time perpetually remodeling his house, Devin has a long history of hobbyhopping. Cooking, baking, SCUBA diving, woodworking, 3D printing, embedded hardware and software, and sewing, to name a few. The list will inevitably continue to grow.
<br><br>
Devin started with Stencil Punks in 2010 and took over the site from the founder, Justin Mayer, around 2012 or so. It went down in 2014 but Devin found an old archive and brought Stencil Punks back online in 2024.
