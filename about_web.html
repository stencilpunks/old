<img src="j_tox.jpg" border="0" align="left">Justin "Toxicated" Mayer<br>
He is 23 years old and works in Philadelphia, PA as a screenprinter in a union shop. "Heads up" the art department at the business he works. Enjoys going to the beach, the movies, shows, and riding scooters. He engages in buddhist practices, but for personal practical purposes rather than religious. He eats a copious amount of meat but generally balances his diet out with bread and vegetables, exercise, and at least a single solid month of vegetarianism a year.

<br><br>Justin founded Stencil Punks. Something of a former digital packrat, he saved almost anything he thinks he'll eventually use until he realizes that he wont and clears out alot of trash off his computer. The stencil collection he owned grew and grew until he decided to post them on a geocities page as backup. He posted it on livejournal a few times and it blew up. 

<br><br>Ironically, Justin doesn't listen to alot of 'teh punk rawk' music. He likes alot of genres: ska, punk, hardcore, indie, alt rock, soul, reggae, dub, etc... He was a "punk" for several years when he was younger, and then later a "skinhead" for about the same amount of time, eventually resisting any stereotype put upon him. 

<br><br>Justin used to maintain this website but handled over the goblet to Devin. He delicately juggles living with a high maintenance girlfriend, full time employment, social interaction between several circles of friends, a handful of social gatherings, and idealistic future plans. He likes playing soccer and supporting his teams:<a href="http://redbull.newyork.mlsnet.com" target="_new">NYRB</a> & <a href="http://www.arsenal.com" target="_new">Arsenal</a>, riding bikes, being mr. fix-it in his aparment, cutting firewood, riding around town on his Stella scooter. He donates blood 6 times a year, ups the punks, has horrible grammer, and rarely capitalises words. He does not have a cell phone, a myspace, or a facebook and frequents a scooter message board. He lives in a rural area several miles outside of Philadelphia city limits.
