Broken gun three-color:

<div class="flex">

![white](/assets/img/stencils/bigd_white.gif)
![red](/assets/img/stencils/bigd_red.gif)
![black](/assets/img/stencils/bigd_black.gif)

</div>

Generally, I would have made up a 3 color tutorial for this design, but to be honest: I dont want to. I would have to redesign this stencil entirely if I were to do that anyway. If you're so adamant about printing up this design, follow the directions on the three color tutorial we have for the anti-nazi symbol over on the anti-fascist page. Print the white first, red second, and black third.
